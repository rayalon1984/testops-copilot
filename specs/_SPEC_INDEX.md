## Feature Specs (Living Manifests)

Structured YAML manifests that link specs → assertions → tests. See `plans/2026-02-21-living-feature-specs.md` for architecture.

| File | Feature | Assertions | Status |
|------|---------|------------|--------|
| `specs/features/giphy-integration.feature.yaml` | Giphy Integration | 14 | Shipped |
| `specs/features/smart-retry.feature.yaml` | Smart Retry with Play Button | 13 | Shipped |
| `specs/features/jira-housekeeping.feature.yaml` | Autonomous Jira Housekeeping | 14 | Shipped |

**Infrastructure**:
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs/features/_schema.ts` | TypeScript types and validation for YAML manifests |
| `specs/features/registry.ts` | Manifest loader, validator, and indexer |
| `backend/src/__tests__/helpers/feature-spec.ts` | Test helpers: `describeFeature()`, `itAssertion()` |
| `scripts/scan-feature-specs.ts` | CI scanner: validate, coverage, drift detection |

**Commands**:
- `npm run validate:specs` — Run the feature spec scanner
- Assertion types: `invariant` (must always hold) · `behavioral` (may evolve) · `contract` (interface boundary)

## Update Rules

- **When shipping a feature**: Update `SPEC.md` + `ROADMAP.md`
- **When adding an API endpoint**: Update `API_CONTRACT.md`
- **When changing AI tools/behavior**: Update `AI_TOOLS.md`
- **When changing security posture**: Update `SECURITY.md`
- **When changing UI patterns**: Update `DESIGN_LANG_V2.md`
- **When changing schema**: Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4
- **When changing deployment**: Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8
